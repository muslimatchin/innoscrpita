## Requirements

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- PHP >= 8.0
- Composer
- Laravel Installer
- Node.js and npm (for frontend assets)
- A database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite, etc.)

---

## Installation

### Local Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-laravel-app.git
   cd your-laravel-app
   ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies**

   Run the following command to install all PHP dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set up the environment variables**

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Open the `.env` file and update the database and other relevant configurations.

4. **Generate the application key**

   Laravel requires an application key to be set. This key is used to encrypt session data and other encrypted data. Generate it using Artisan:

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Set up the database**

   Create a database and update your `.env` file with the correct credentials for your database.

   Run the migrations to set up your database schema:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. **Install frontend dependencies**

   Install frontend dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

7. **Compile assets**

   After installing the dependencies, compile your frontend assets:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

---

### Development Environment Setup

If you're working in a development environment (e.g., Docker, Homestead, etc.), follow the instructions below.

1. **Using Docker**

   If you are using Docker, you can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to set up the application:

   - Build and start the Docker containers:

     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

   - Enter the application container:

     ```bash
     docker-compose exec app bash
     ```

   - Follow the same installation steps for database and assets as outlined in the local environment setup.

2. **Using Homestead**

   If you're using Laravel Homestead:

   - Ensure that Homestead is installed and properly set up.
   - SSH into the Homestead box:

     ```bash
     vagrant ssh
     ```

   - Navigate to the application directory and follow the installation steps for local setup.

---

## Configuration

Make sure you have the following configurations in your `.env` file:

- **APP_URL**: URL of the app (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)
- **DB_CONNECTION**: Database connection type (`mysql`, `sqlite`, etc.)
- **MAIL_MAILER**: Set up your mail driver (e.g., SMTP or Mailgun) if you're using email features.

You may also want to set up an email service for sending verification emails. Check out Laravel's official mail documentation for details on setting up email services.

---

## Running the Application

After setting up everything, you can run the application using the built-in Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

This will start the application at `http://localhost:8000`.

For development environments using Docker or Homestead, you can access the app based on the configuration of your container or Vagrant box.

---

## Additional Information

- **Running Tests**: To run tests, you can use PHPUnit.

   ```bash
   php artisan test
   ```

- **Mail Configuration**: If you are sending emails (e.g., verification emails), you need to configure your mailer in `.env` and ensure you have a mail driver set up.

This README should help guide you in setting up and running your Laravel News Aggregator API in both local and development environments.
